# Ephemeral

This is the README file for the COMP-4990 group project tentatively titled, "Ephemeral".

Group Members: Dariq Ahmed, Jason Cala, Ravi Trivedi

Group Supervisor: Dr. Sherif Saad Ahmed

Project Objective: Build a multiplayer survival horror video game.

Project Description: Our goal for this project is to build an alpha version of the game.
To clarify, we plan to complete a game that can be played from start to finish, but we acknowledge that it would not be the final version.
In a hypothetical scenario, the alpha version would be the game before it has undergone focused troubleshooting and beta testing with test groups from the target audience.
